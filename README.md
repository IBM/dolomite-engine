# Getting Started
Run `make install` to install the requirements for this repository. You might need to install `flash-attn`.

# Distributed finetuning
This repository is meant for finetuning large language models (of any scale) using multiple backends. The following backends are currently supported:

1. [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html)
1. [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)

The repository currently only supports generative models but can be easily extended to non-generative models if needed. 2 main class of models from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) are supported:

1. decoder models (`AutoModelForCausalLM`) like Granite, Llama, BLOOM etc
1. encoder-decoder models (`AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`) like T5, BART etc

Please note that this repository doesn't support Tensor Parallel or Pipeline Parallel (yet :wink:).

# HuggingFace compatible custom models
This repository works with all HuggingFace models (text-to-text only for the moment) out-of-the-box. The checkpoints have to be in safetensors format, if not you can check `tools/pt_to_safetensors.py`. If your model_type is `gpt_megatron` just change it to `gpt_dolomite`.

> [!TIP]
> You might be able to enjoy additional memory and computation savings when finetuning your models using the [padding free transformers optimization](https://huggingface.co/blog/mayank-mishra/padding-free-transformer). This optimization is currently only supported for decoder models and requires converting your model (say LLama-3 for example) to a [custom class](dolomite_engine/hf_models/models/gpt_dolomite/) implemented in this repo. This is completely optional and not required for finetuning. The conversion can be achieved as follows:
```python
from dolomite_engine.hf_models import import_from_huggingface

import_from_huggingface(
    pretrained_model_name_or_path="ibm-granite/granite-3b-code-base",
    save_path="dolomite_compatible_model"
)
```
Once done training, you can convert the model back to the HF class as:
```python
from dolomite_engine.hf_models import export_to_huggingface

export_to_huggingface(
    pretrained_model_name_or_path="trained_checkpoint",
    save_path="hf_compatible_model",
    model_type="llama",
)
```

If you are interested in using this optimization outside this repo for some reason, you can do as follows:
```python
import torch
from dolomite_engine.hf_models import GPTDolomiteForCausalLM


# we need unpadded lists here for avoiding any useless computations on pad tokens
# this is a bit different from the standard transformer which takes in tensors and an attention mask
# if you turn off padding free transformers, you can use the tensor inputs with this class too
input_ids = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0], [6, 7, 8, 0]]
labels = [[-100, -100, -100, 4, 5, 0], [-100, -100, 8, 0]]

# this will throw a warning saying that the model is of gpt_bigcode class
# ignore the warning
model = GPTDolomiteForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    <model_path>,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"
    use_padding_free_transformer=True,
).cuda()

loss = model(
    input_ids=input_ids,
    labels=labels,
).loss
```

Note that padding free transformers doesn't support generation and thus for running generation on the model, you will need to load the model without padding-free transformers.

# Usage
The typical training workflow looks like:
1. [Pretraining](scripts/pretrain.sh) or [Finetuning](scripts/finetune.sh): This is the actual training process
```shell
# for finetuning
sh scripts/finetune.sh configs/sst2/training.yml
```
```shell
# for pretraining
sh scripts/pretrain.sh configs/pretraining-examples/pretrain-1.yml
```

2. [Inference](scripts/generate.sh): Run inference on the trained models or the un-trained model
```shell
sh scripts/generate.sh configs/sst2/inference.yml
```

3. [Unshard the checkpoint](scripts/unshard.sh): This is used to unshard the model to a safetensors checkpoint since dolomite-engine saves a sharded model during training
```shell
sh scripts/unshard.sh configs/sst2/unshard.yml
```

## Using custom datasets
The data directory should obey the following structure:
```text
ðŸ“¦data
 â”£ ðŸ“‚train
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename1.jsonl
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename2.jsonl
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œfilename3.jsonl
 â”— ðŸ“‚val
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename1.jsonl
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename2.jsonl
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename3.jsonl
 â”£ ðŸ“‚test
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename1.jsonl
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename2.jsonl
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œfilename3.jsonl
```
Filenames can be anything as long as there are no whitespaces in them. Each line in each file should be a json (jsonlines file format) with the entries looking like:
```json
{"input": "The movie sucks", "output": "negative"}
{"input": "The movie was awesome", "output": "positive"}
```
Note for the test set, only `input` field is needed in the json instances in each line. `output` field is not needed.  

All the files in each directory are concatenated to form the respective split.  

If you need reformatting of the examples, you can use `input_format` and `output_format` arguments. For example `input_format = 'Classify the sentiment of the sentence:\n__input__\nSentiment:'` and `output_format = ' __output__'` reformats the input and output examples to:
```text
INPUT:
Classify the sentiment of the sentence:
The movie sucks
Sentiment:

OUTPUT:
 negative
```
If you don't need any reformatting, leave the arguments `input_format` and `output_format` to their default values `__input__` and `__output__` respectively.  

Please note that the user is expected to provide this at both training and inference time.  

Try not to have trailing spaces in `input_format`, if you need a space between input and output, the space should be part of the `output_format` as in the above example.

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, you can also add your own dataset class in the repository if you don't want to use the jsonlines format or need custom logic to load your own dataset.

Currently, the repo has following implemented dataclasses:
```text
AlpacaDataset
DebugDataset
DollyDataset
HuggingFaceDataset
SlimOrcaDataset
SST2Dataset
```

## Using Megatron Dataset outside of this repository
This repository implements the dataloader from Megatron-LM for efficient pretraining. If for some reason you need to use that dataloader outside this repository, take a look at [this example](tools/megatron_dataset/megatron_dataloader.py).

## Supported optimizers
We support all of the following optimizers. The default optimizer is `TorchAdamW`. Note that using the [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) or [Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) optimizers will require installing the respective pip package.
